# Analysis
## Business Questions

1. How is overall sales performance trending over time compared to the prior year?
2. Which product variants drive the most revenue vs the most unit volume?
3. How much revenue is lost to discounts and returns?
4. Who are the most valuable customers by spend and frequency?
5. Which traffic sources generate the most sessions?
6. How concentrated is revenue across products and customers?

## Q1) Trend & YoY Performance

Key Insights:

Overall demand declined YoY: Total orders fell 16.1% (390 vs 465), indicating lower transaction volume in 2025 compared to 2024.

Average order value also declined: AOV decreased 15.9% YoY ($118 vs $140), compounding the impact of lower order volume.

Early-year weakness drove the decline: January–March saw the steepest YoY drops, with orders down 50–66% compared to the prior year.

Mid-to-late year recovery in volume: July–October showed strong YoY order growth (up to +189% in August), partially offsetting early losses.

Volume recovery did not translate to revenue strength: Despite higher order counts in the second half, AOV remained consistently below prior-year levels, suggesting smaller baskets or heavier discounting.

## Q2) Product Performance (Revenue vs Units)

Key Insights:

Revenue is highly concentrated in a small number of products: The Custom IWB Sidecar Holster alone generated over $10.4K, making it the top revenue driver.

Top revenue and top volume products broadly overlap: Custom IWB, IWB Sidecar, and OWB holsters rank highly by both total sales and units sold, indicating consistent demand for core custom products.

Long-tail products contribute minimal volume and revenue: Most non-custom holsters sold fewer than 5 units, contributing marginal revenue individually.

Product mix favors custom holsters: Custom-configured holsters dominate both revenue and unit volume, suggesting they are the core of Customer Holster Solutions' business model.

High-volume does not always imply high revenue: Beyond the top few products, unit volume drops sharply while revenue contribution becomes negligible.

## Q3) Discounts & Returns

Key Insights:

Discounting materially impacts revenue for discounted orders: Among orders with recorded discount activity, discounts reduced gross sales by 16.2%, lowering revenue from $1,657.88 to $1,389.85.

Returns are not a meaningful driver of revenue loss: Total returns were effectively zero, indicating minimal post-purchase churn or refund activity within discounted orders.

Revenue pressure is driven by pricing strategy, not fulfillment issues: With no significant returns, the gap between gross and net sales is attributable almost entirely to discounts.

Discounting appears broad rather than order-specific: No individual orders showed unusually high discount amounts, suggesting discounts are applied systematically (e.g., promotions or pricing strategy) rather than ad hoc.

## Q4) Customer Value & Revenue Concentration

Key Insights:

Revenue is moderately concentrated, not dominated by a few customers:
The top 20 customers account for approximately 20% of total net revenue, indicating a diversified customer base rather than reliance on a small number of high-value accounts.

One customer represents a clear revenue outlier:
The highest-spending customer alone generated 6.5% of total revenue, while the remaining top customers contribute smaller but relatively even amounts.

High revenue is driven by two distinct customer profiles:
Some top customers rank highly due to single large purchases, while others generate similar revenue through repeat ordering, reflecting both high-AOV and high-frequency buyer segments.

Repeat customers provide steadier revenue contribution:
Customers with multiple orders exhibit more consistent average order values, suggesting stronger long-term value and retention potential compared to one-time high-spend buyers.

Growth opportunity lies in retention and repeat purchasing:
With most revenue coming from the long tail of customers, improving repeat purchase rates represents a meaningful opportunity to increase overall revenue without additional acquisition spend.

## Q5) Traffic Sources & Session Contribution

Key Insights:

Traffic is extremely concentrated in two primary sources:
Direct traffic and Google organic search each account for approximately 45% of total sessions, combining to drive nearly 90% of all site traffic.

Direct traffic represents the single largest acquisition channel:
Direct sessions alone contribute 45% of total traffic, suggesting strong brand recognition, repeat visitors, or untagged referral activity.

Search traffic is overwhelmingly driven by Google:
Google organic search generates virtually all search-driven sessions, with alternative search engines contributing only marginal volume.

All other channels contribute minimally on an individual basis:
Social media, paid search, email, and referral sources each account for less than 3% of total sessions individually, forming a long tail of low-volume traffic sources.

Traffic diversification is limited, creating channel concentration risk:
Heavy reliance on direct and Google traffic exposes the business to attribution blind spots and potential volatility from search algorithm changes.

## Q6) Revenue Concentration & Dependency

Key Insights:

Revenue is highly concentrated in a small number of product groupings:
The single largest revenue bucket (records with a NULL product title) accounts for 49.9% of total revenue, indicating that nearly half of sales are associated with products or variants lacking a normalized product title.

Core custom holster products dominate sales performance:
The top three named products —
Custom IWB Sidecar, Custom IWB, and Custom OWB — collectively drive an additional ~38% of total revenue, bringing cumulative revenue concentration to nearly 88% across four product groupings.

Long-tail products contribute minimally to overall revenue:
Beyond the top four product groupings, individual SKUs each contribute less than 1% of revenue, confirming a classic Pareto distribution in product performance.

Customer revenue is moderately concentrated but not overly dependent on a few buyers:

50% of total revenue is generated by 107 customers

80% of total revenue is generated by 226 customers

Out of 348 total customers, this indicates a relatively healthy spread of customer value rather than extreme whale dependency.

Revenue risk is product-concentrated, not customer-concentrated:

While customer spend is distributed across hundreds of buyers, revenue dependency is strongly tied to a small set of core product offerings.
